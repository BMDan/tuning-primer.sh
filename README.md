## About this repository

This is the script originally developed by Matthew Montgomery, and previously hosted at Day32.com.  This version has been updated and improved for newer versions of MySQL, Percona Server, and MariaDB.  This Github repository was created with Matthew's permission by Dan Reif, but Matthew has no control over it; in other words, please don't bother Matthew with questions about this repository!

This repository will be used to handle ongoing development and bugfixes for this script.  Please file bug reports <a href="https://github.com/BMDan/tuning-primer.sh/issues">here</a>.  Pull requests are welcomed.

## About this script
This script takes information from `SHOW STATUS LIKE...` and `SHOW VARIABLES LIKE...` to produce sane recomendations for tuning server variables. 

It (attempts to be!) compatible with all versions of MySQL 3.23 and higher (including 5.x), as well as MariaDB, and Percona Server for MySQL.&sup2;

Currently it handles recommendations for the following:

* Slow Query Log
* Max Connections
* Worker Threads
* Key Buffer [MyISAM only]
* Query Cache
* Sort Buffer
* Joins
* Temp Tables
* Table (Open & Definition) Cache
* Table Locking
* Table Scans (`read_buffer`) [MyISAM only]
* InnoDB Status

### Recent Changes

* Updated to (at least mostly) support MySQL 5.7+ and MariaDB
* A lot of cleanup of the underlying code
* Better handling of terminals and redirection (got rid of the hardcoded color sequences, switched to proper terminfo)
* <a href="https://github.com/BMDan/tuning-primer.sh/commit/6b5d866f7525b250bb4ecb0deffd66531e375143">Fixed</a> the old ``./tuning-primer.sh: line 402: export: `2097152': not a valid identifier`` bug

More, as always, in the <a href="https://github.com/BMDan/tuning-primer.sh/commits/master">changelog</a>.

### Footnotes
&sup1;: Running it without downloading it and reading it first is a truly awful choice, and I arguably shouldn't put this command here.  Then again, if you are the sort of person who even _wonders how_ to run a script with _root access to your database_ by piping it into Bash, you're probably the sort of person I can't convince not to do so.  At least these instructions are ever-so-slightly safer than what'll appear on some Stack Overflow if I didn't put this here.

&sup2;: ... and anything else sufficiently MySQLish to export the status variables it uses to run.
